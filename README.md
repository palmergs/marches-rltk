## Western Marches

This is a attempt to learn the `bracket-lib` rogue-like library and also work a little bit on my Rust skills.

### Run

Probably something like this:

```
> git checkout western-rltk
> cd western-rltk
> cargo run --release
```

### TODO

* No character builder
* No town or stores
* No items or inventory
* No spells or effects
* No stairs or additional levels
* No save or load game
* No win condition
* Also seems a bit sluggish

### Known Bugs
* The Image file used for the actor and item layers renders many greens as transparent
